title: "Downloading R and RStudio"
---

You can download a version of R/RStudio to your own computer if you'd prefer that over the R Server. Since they are two distinct things (a language and an application for running that language), you will need to download them separately. First need to download R and then download RStudio. Both are free, open source, and updated regularly.

## R

To download R, go to [the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) page](https://cran.r-project.org/) and under Downloads, choose the correct version for your computer, likely Mac or Windows. Then, if you are a Windows user, click "install R for the first time". If you are a Mac user, you will see a list of available versions of R depending on your operating system, but frequently the top download is what you want. For both Mac and Windows, double click and install R after downloading.

## RStudio

Next, [download RStudio from the Posit website](https://posit.co/downloads/). This website should recognize the correct version for your computer and will give you a single download button. It will also give you a link to download R if you haven't already done so. Install RStudio after downloading by double clicking the icon and agreeing to the terms.

[See this page for more details about downloading and using RStudio on your desktop computer.](https://www.reed.edu/data-at-reed/r/r-at-reed/desktop-r.html)

R will periodically tell you to update and when you need to do this, just go to the same sites to download the most recent versions.
