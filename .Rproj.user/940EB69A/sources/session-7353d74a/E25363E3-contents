Next time we will learn about how to create variables within R and how to use functions to perform simple actions, like finding a mean. I advise you to either try out the server or download R/RStudio before then. However, the coding that we do will largely be within an interactive document, so it is not imperative for next week.

If you want to look ahead in R, you can go through the [New to R page](https://www.reed.edu/data-at-reed/r/new-to-r/) on the [Data\@Reed website](https://www.reed.edu/data-at-reed/).

And if you're looking for specific help, don't forget about [the DataLab](https://www.reed.edu/data-at-reed/data_lab/)!
